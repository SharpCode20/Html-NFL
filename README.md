HTML (CSS &amp; Database) Practice

In this repository, I will be practicing my coding using HTML and CSS to develop a website for the NFL.
The data that is entered into this website will be stored in a database using PhpMyAdmin. There are
many things I can do with this coding practice, so many updates are to come!
